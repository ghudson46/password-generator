# password generator
a random password generator created using javascript. This app allows the user to select password preferences (number of characters, upper or lower case characters, numbers, and special characters. It will then use that criteria to create a random password.

## methods
I used the character code in javascript to pull the numbers and lower and uppercase letters from their numbered place. I also decided to use checkboxes instead of confirm() to get the criteria for the password from the user. This let me use id selectors to efficiently target each input and apply it to the function
